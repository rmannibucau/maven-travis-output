= Maven Travis Output

Ensure something is written on the output each minute.

It helps maven builds when executed with `-q` or a customized log level
and a lot of things is happening behind the scene (avoids "false" Travis timeouts).

== Setup

There are multiple ways to do it but one simple is to grab the jar
and pass it in maven ext system properties:

[source]
----
mvn dependency:copy -Dartifact=com.github.rmannibucau:maven-travis-output:1.0.0 -DoutputDirectory=/tmp
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Dmaven.ext.class.path=/tmp/maven-travis-output-1.0.0.jar -B -q -e"
----
